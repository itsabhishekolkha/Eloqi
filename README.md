## üí° **Technical Excellence**

### ‚ö° **Optimized Performance**
- **Native Swift/SwiftUI** implementation for maximum macOS integration
- **Apple Silicon optimization** with only CPU acceleration
       (ClearVoice currently supports WAV files only. To convert other file types to WAV, use the Audio Conversion option in the Tools section. Audio conversion will produce the highest quality possible, resulting in larger file sizes, which may increase ClearVoice processing time as files are generated using CPU only, why???, Well CUDA is not supported on macOS because it requires NVIDIA GPUs (available on Linux/Windows) so Mac os will use CPU only.)
- **Efficient memory management** for large audio files
- **Asynchronous processing** with real-time progress updates
- **Background task handling** with proper resource cleanup


### üîí **Privacy & Security**
- **100% local processing** - your audio never leaves your device
- **No telemetry or data collection** - complete privacy
- **Sandboxed execution** with proper macOS security integration
- **Temporary file cleanup** - automatic resource management
- **Application Support integration** for proper macOS file organization

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

## Installation

### Download and Install
1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://pub-0c627237fa784b5baec2d7b5d777c96a.r2.dev/releases/Eloqi-v1.0.0.dmg)
2. Drag Eloqi to your Applications folder to complete the installation

### Important Security Notice for macOS Users

When you first attempt to open Eloqi, macOS may display a warning message stating that the app "cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer" or that it "may damage your computer." **This is a normal security response and does not indicate any actual threat.**

#### Why This Happens
As an independent student developer, I currently don't have an Apple Developer License, which means:
- The app is not code-signed with Apple's official developer certificate
- The app has not been notarized through Apple's automated security review process
- macOS Gatekeeper treats unsigned applications as potentially unsafe by default

This is a standard security measure Apple implements for all unsigned applications, regardless of their actual safety.

#### How to Open Eloqi Safely

**Method 1: Using Terminal (Recommended)**
```bash
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Eloqi.app
```
This command removes the quarantine flag that prevents the app from opening. After running this command, Eloqi will launch normally.

**Method 2: System Preferences**
1. Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy
2. Click "Open Anyway" when the blocked app notification appears
3. Confirm your choice when prompted

#### Future Plans
I am working toward obtaining proper code signing certificates to eliminate this security warning in future releases. Thank you for your understanding as I continue developing Eloqi as a student project.

*If you encounter any issues during installation, please [open an issue](https://github.com/yourusername/eloqi/issues) on GitHub.*
4. **First launch** - macOS will verify the app signature
5. **Grant permissions** for file access when prompted

### **Getting Started with Eloqi**

#### **Text-to-Speech (Piper TTS)**
1. Select your preferred voice and quality level
2. Download voice models from settings(one-time setup per voice)
   Note: There is a bug in the app that when user downloads any voice it doesn't appear in downloaded voices instantly to resolve this after downloading voices close settings and reopen, that's it voices are now appears as downloaded.
4. Enter your text and choose output location
5. Generate high-quality speech audio

#### **ClearVoice Enhancement**
1. Choose the appropriate AI model for your audio type
2. Select input audio file (supports most formats)
3. Pick enhancement task (noise reduction, separation, etc.)
4. Watch real-time progress as AI processes your audio

### üí° **Pro Tips**
- **Voice Models**: Download multiple voices for different projects
- **AI Models**: MossFormer2 models offer the best quality for most use cases
- **Batch Processing**: Use Media Tools for processing multiple files
- **Performance**: Apple Silicon Macs provide 2-3x faster AI processing(only with CPU)
